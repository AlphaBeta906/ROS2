## Preamble
<p>
<b><span class="text-3xl font-bold">W</span>E</b>, the people of Solemania,

**INSPIRED** by the many forms of patriotism alive in the history of Solemania, striving to fight for a free, and liberated Solemania;
<blockquote>
by the indigenous communities among the Solemani archipelago who resisted submission to the Daux;<br><br>

by the slaves who resisted their masters;<br><br>

by those who fought for the liberty of the Solemani islands;<br><br>

by the various war heroes who defended Solemania, even in its darkest hours;<br><br>

by those who contributed the formation of the constitution, to the day that this constitution was finalized; and<br><br>

by the many contributions, both big and small, that provided pride to the peoples of Solemania
</blockquote>

**RECOGNIZING** the diverse people whom inhabit the Solemani islands;
<blockquote>
the indigenous peoples who's ancestors sailed across the oceans, to find land to settle upon, their ownership of the islands, their unique culture, religion, customs, traditions and language;<br><br>

the Daux immigrants who's ancestors inhabited the newly colonized Solemania, their culture, religions, customs, traditions and languages;<br><br>

the descendants of the slaves that were shipped from Daux colonies during the colonization period, their culture, religions, customs, traditions and languages; and<br><br>

those who migrated to the Solemani islands for peace and/or safety, their culture, religions, customs, traditions and languages.
</blockquote>

**DETERMINED** to fulfil the legacy that our national heros fought for, the martyrs who fought the Daux for the ownership of the islands who were trying to occupy the princely states, the pirates who wanted to liberate Solemania and make it an egalitarian society, the warriors who fought in its fight for freedom, and the countless other revolts that happened across the archipelago.

**COMMITTED** to prevent a greater Solemani civil war between the three major divisions of Solemania: Sakuille, Turkém, and Mahapur, and the various minority and native groups against Solemania.

**DECLARE** that all peoples within the islands that was once believed to be patronized by Xa'kusao, are equal and independent in all respects, as-well as united as one;

**RECOGNIZE** that this constitution is the common law of the islands, and to provide a framework for future amendments;

**COMMITTED** to the recognition and protection of universal human rights, and the preservation of human dignity and freedom;

**DECLARE** our will to make a society that is founded on the beliefs of egalitarianism, individualism, liberty, peace and progress.

**AND HEREBY ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION FOR THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF SOLEMANIA, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ETERNAL DICTATOR IN WHICH THIS NATION STANDS.**
