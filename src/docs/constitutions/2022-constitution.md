<b><span class="text-3xl font-bold">W</span>E</b>, the people of Solemania,

**INSPIRED** by the many forms of patriotism alive in the history of Solemania, whom strives to fight for a free, and liberated Solemania;
<blockquote>
by the indigenous communities among the Solemani archipelago whom resisted submission to the Daux;<br><br>

by the slaves who resisted their masters;<br><br>

by those who fought for the liberty of the Solemani islands;<br><br>

by the various war heroes who defended Solemania, even in it's darkest hours;<br><br>

</blockquote>

**DETERMINED** to fulfil the legacy that our national heros fought for, the martyrs who fought the Daux for the ownership of the islands who were trying to occupy the princely states, the pirates who wanted to liberate Solemania and make it an egalitarian society, the warriors who fought in its fight for freedom, and the countless other revolts that happened across the archipelago.
